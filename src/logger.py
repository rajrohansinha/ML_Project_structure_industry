# Logging Setup â€“ Simple Explanation

# Step 1: We import the tools needed:
#         - logging: to save messages about what our code is doing
#         - os: to work with folders and file paths
#         - datetime: to add current date and time into the log file name

# Step 2: We create a unique log file name using the current time
#         This keeps each run separate and easy to track

# Step 3: We create a folder called "logs" (if it doesn't exist)
#         This folder will store our log files safely

# Step 4: We set the full path where the log file will be saved
#         The file will go inside the "logs" folder

# Step 5: We configure how logging should work
#         - Where to save logs
#         - What each log entry should look like (time, line, name, level, message)
#         - What kind of messages to save (INFO and above)

# This setup helps us track problems or actions in our app step by step
